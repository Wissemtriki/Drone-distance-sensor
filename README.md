# Drone Distance Sensor

Python project using a **Raspberry Pi** and **ultrasonic sensor** to measure distance in real time for drones.  
Provides scripts for obstacle detection, reading sensor data via GPIO, and computing distances efficiently for drone navigation or robotics applications.

### Tools Used
- Raspberry Pi
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Python 3.x

### How to Run
1. Connect the ultrasonic sensor to Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.  
2. Run the main Python file:  
```bash
python3 main.py
```
3. Observe the distance output in the terminal.
